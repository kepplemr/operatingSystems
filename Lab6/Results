#1 - Increase the primary boot loader's timeout to 7 seconds.
What I did: changed timeout in /boot.cfg to 7.

Diff output:
2c2
< timeout=5
---
> timeout=7

#2 - Change the secondary boot loader's prompt from ">" to ">>"
What I did: edited /usr/src/sys/arch/i386/stand/lib/menuutils.c then cd'd to
/usr/src/sys/arch/i386/stand/boot/ and did a 'make' and a 'make install'. Then
I cd'd to /usr/src/commands/updateboot/ and ran 'updateboot.sh'

Diff output:

<           printf("> ");
---
>           printf(">> ");

#3 - Change to uppercase the portions of the initial greeting related to
RELEASE and VERSION. Also change "Minix" to "MINIX L06"
What I did: changed /usr/src/servers/pm/misc.c to new system name "MINIX LAB 06"
Did a make and a 'make install' in that directory and then a 'make hdbuild' from 
/usr/src/releasetools.

Diff output:
34c34
<   "Minix",        /* system name */
---
>   "MINIX L06",       /* system name */

What I did for the RELASE/VERSION stuff: edited /usr/src/commands/getty.c to
uppercased version of original static char* def_banner. Then did a make and 
'make install' in /usr/src/commands/getty/.

Diff output:
91c91
<   static char *def_banner[] = { "%s Release %r Version %v (%t)\n\n%n login:", 0 };
---
<   static char *def_banner[] = { "%s RELEASE %r VERSION %v (%t)\n\n%n login:", 0 };

#4 - Add at least one virtual console.
What I did: Edited /usr/src/include/minix/config.h to increase maximum amount
of virtual consoles.
Diff output:
52c52
< #define NR_CONS          4  /* # system consoles (1 to 8) */
---
> #define NR_CONS          5  /* # system consoles (1 to 8) */

What I did: Edited /usr/src/etc/ttys to include a new ttyc (ttyc4).
Diff output:
9a10
> ttyc4         getty         minix     on secure

What I did: cd to /dev/ and ran 'MAKEDEV ttyc4' and then ran 'make hdboot' from
/usr/src/releasetools
